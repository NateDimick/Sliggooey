this is a completely disorganized list of ideas for things to do or research

* reconcile front end room state
* remove `front` property from `PaneInfo`
* send `leave` when closing room pane
* finish handling room messages
  * notify - back and front
  * chatTs - ?
  * : - ?
  * uhtml + **uhtmlchange** in the front
* Battle Manager Pane
  * where ladder search will eventually live
  * where current games will be re-accessible if their pane was closed
  * where challenges can be displayed (as well as in private chats)
* handle battle input
* recover on all major go routines
* hit submit button when hit enter on login, chat boxes
* remember login info
* figure out how to get current games
  * possibly done now that updateSearch was fixed
* chat self button on chatPane
* investigate switch to sveltekit frontend
* handle websocket disconnect/reconnect
* proper logging rather than console printing
* application versioning
* ci/cd? (is it even worth it?)
