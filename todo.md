this is a completely disorganized list of ideas for things to do or research

* send battle requests straight through without unmarshalling in go (no added value)
* send battle search json straight through without unmarshalling in go (no added value)
* reconcile front end room state
* finish handling room messages
  * notify - back and front
  * chatTs - ?
  * : - ?
  * uhtml + **uhtmlchange** in the front
* Battle Manager Pane
  * where ladder search will eventually live
* handle battle input
* recover on all major go routines
* hit submit button when hit enter on login, chat boxes
* remember login info
* chat self button on chatPane
* investigate switch to sveltekit frontend
* handle websocket disconnect/reconnect
* proper logging rather than console printing
* application versioning
* ci/cd? (is it even worth it?)
