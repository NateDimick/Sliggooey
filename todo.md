this is a completely disorganized list of ideas for things to do or research

* remove ShowdownUser struct
* reconcile front end room state
  * mostly done - last chunk has to do with the following:
  * dealing with inactive pokemon
  * dealing with pokemon status updates
    * hp changes
    * forme changes
    * status changes
* finish handling room messages
  * notify - back and front
  * chatTs - ?
  * : - ?
  * uhtml + **uhtmlchange** in the front
* Battle Manager Pane
  * where ladder search will eventually live
* handle battle input
  * Mostly done, requires testing in double battles (down the line)
* recover on all major go routines
* hit submit button when hit enter on login, chat boxes
* remember login info
* chat self button on chatPane
* handle websocket disconnect/reconnect
* query games and challenges on login
* proper logging rather than console printing
* application versioning
* ci/cd? (is it even worth it?)
